## Test Instructions:
Scroll down to the questions section and click my deployed link. It will take the user to the App where they can view the employee directory table, use the search bar to filter the directory and search for the employee's first name, a reset button to bring back the list, and sorting buttons for first name, last name, and email in ascending/descending order. Or if you would like to run in on your localhost, just copy my repo(scroll down to questions section and click the repo link) copy it to your drive, open up vscode, go to your terminal and type npm install to install the dependencies. then type: npm run start.

## Challenges: 

The challenging part of this assignment was everything... from getting the values to appear on the screen, reading the errors and trying to figure out how to fix it, syntax errors, getting the values to appear on the screen, search bar not working properly, was creating a new list of employees everytime i submitted, sorting was difficult, filtering didn't work the way I wanted it to work, and the reset button did the same thing and created a new list of employees. Overall, getting the values to appear on the screen was the hardest. I worked on this assignment everyday and for 4 solid days it would show. After study group and learning how to use the .map method properly i was able to get my values to show. Then I had to fix the table, because it was showing my table headers for every employee. Once I finally got it all to work, I realized that I accidentally installed axios outside of my folder and needed to fix that issue, delete my package-lock.json, my node_modules, move everything in my client folder into the employeeDirectory folder and install the dependencies again.
